# Transforming Data Into Actionable Business Insights

## Hi, I'm Mary 👋🏻💻

As a marketing professional I understand all too well how businesses struggle to access reliable data. In 2018 I started using Excel Spreadsheets to help my company understand the importance of the marketing activities we were doing. Over the passed 2 years, that has grown into managing a comprehensive KPI dashboard that our management team uses to plan future marketing and sales activities. 

**I have a passion for data.** I am constantly putting myself to the test, learning, and finding more efficient ways read, work with, analyze, and argue with data. As an aspiring data analyst, I am learning the tools and languages it takes to clean data, and craft a compelling story.
