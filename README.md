# Hi, I'm Mary 👋🏻💻

## I am a content creator turned data geek. This is my journey.

As a marketing professional I understand all too well how businesses struggle to access reliable data. And with third party cookie applications slowly going away due to increased scrutiny, this is forcing brands to prioritize tactics that rely on first party data. Unfortunately, that data is either unorganized or full of errors.

As an aspiring data analyst I’m learning the tools and languages it takes to clean data, and craft a compelling story. This journal will be my place to store notes, and explore key concepts of data analysis.
